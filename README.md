# Corona FAQ

This is the source code behind https://www.virusbhagao.com/.

The web app reads aloud basic coronavirus information in Indian languages. The goal is to convey the basics of coronavirus to most regional language users in small cities/villages of India. Literacy is not a barrier, the app uses a text to speech interface to read the content aloud.

There is an abundance of misinformation and superstition regarding coronavirus, and surprisingly few sources which give out verified facts. Our only source of information is a subset of: https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses, which we translate to Indian languages.

Currently, we are looking for tamil and telugu translators for (2-3 hours of volunteer translation work)

Please help us spread the word, especially to people who need this.
